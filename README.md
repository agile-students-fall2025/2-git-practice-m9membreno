## Article Summary: Project Management at Big Tech
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/project-management-at-big-tech/
Making that transition of being a consumer of knowledge into a producer of ideas is a jump that most CS students are eagered to make, so I enjoy reading articles where I can inspect the application of practices in Big tech. The article speaks on how companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix largely avoid formal methodologies like Scrum, instead giving engineers significant autonomy to choose their own working styles. I was surprised learning that these companies don't have dedicated project managers for team-level work; instead, engineers themselves lead projects, with Technical Program Managers only stepping in for complex, multi-team initiatives. The author's comparison between Skype (which adopted Scrum) and WhatsApp (which ignored formal processes entirely) really struck me. As someone studying CS, developing strong problem-solving skills, technical competence, and the ability to work autonomously will always be the most appealing. The emphasis on engineer-to-engineer communication and minimal bureaucracy is what software engineers yearn for in the process, overall.

## Buki's comment
That's interesting that big compaires give software engineers autonomy on their working styles. I'm curious as to how that works in practice - I'd love to experience it.
